      - Certificates of deposit are considered one of the safest investments from bank accounts and give a higher interest rate than savings accounts. However, the money has to be locked for a certain amount of time or there will be a penalty. This higher rate is due to the fact that since your money is locked up longer, the bank can utilize your money for long term investments such as loans.

      - U.S savings bonds are bonds that can be purchased with a generally high interest. Like taxes, this money is used to purchase US government expenses such as projects and operations. There are two types of these bonds, Series EE and Series I. Series EE bonds are sold at face value and when collected, will be worth that face value plus and interest earned onto it. On the other hand, while Series I bonds are also sold at face value, the amount you receive back will be based on both inflation and the amount of interest.

    Cards
  </h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/credit-cards/personal-finance-101-charge-cards-versus-debit-cards-versus-credit-cards-pros-and-cons/"> Credit Card </a>
      - A credit card allows you to purchase things without having the money at hand, meaning the money spent will be in debt to the credit card company. It allows for you to spend as much money as you want, as long as it does not exceed your charge limit. Your charge limit is the amount of money your bank allows you to spend, this amount depending on your credit card history. When the amount needs to be paid back you will receive a minimum amount that needs to be paid each month, though it is a good idea to pay as much back as one, as the more interest will build up as time goes by. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/credit-cards/personal-finance-101-charge-cards-versus-debit-cards-versus-credit-cards-pros-and-cons/"> Debit Card </a>
      - A debit card is a card that like a credit card allows you to purchase things, but instead of loaning form the bank, is taken directly out of your checking account, therefore, you can not buy anything with money you don’t have at hand, as the amount in your checking account is the amount that is allowed to be used. An advantage of this is knowing the amount of money there is on their card, makes people less likely to make impulse spendings.

    <a href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/credit-cards/personal-finance-101-charge-cards-versus-debit-cards-versus-credit-cards-pros-and-cons/"> Charge Cards </a>
      - A charge card is similar to a credit card, as the money you use is being loaned from the bank and you can spend money you don’t have at hand, but all the money has to be paid by the end of the month. This is beneficial as the amount of interest on spending will not build up, and you will have to pay back less. However, this is also bad as you will need to pay all of it back by the end.
