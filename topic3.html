      <br/>
	  A credit card allows you to purchase things without having the money at hand, meaning the money spent will be in debt to the credit card company. It allows for you to spend as much money as you want, as long as it does not exceed your charge limit. Your charge limit is the amount of money your bank allows you to spend, this amount depending on your credit card history. When the amount needs to be paid back you will receive a minimum amount that needs to be paid each month, though it is a good idea to pay as much back as one, as the more interest will build up as time goes by.

      <br/>
	  A debit card is a card that like a credit card allows you to purchase things, but instead of loaning form the bank, is taken directly out of your checking account, therefore, you can not buy anything with money you don’t have at hand, as the amount in your checking account is the amount that is allowed to be used. An advantage of this is knowing the amount of money there is on their card, makes people less likely to make impulse spendings.

      <br/>
	  A charge card is similar to a credit card, as the money you use is being loaned from the bank and you can spend money you don’t have at hand, but all the money has to be paid by the end of the month. This is beneficial as the amount of interest on spending will not build up, and you will have to pay back less. However, this is also bad as you will need to pay all of it back by the end.
