	  Health insurance covers medical expenses. It covers many but not all injuries, and doctors visits. Health insurance consists of your premium, deductibles, copayment, coinsurance, and your out-of-pocket limit. Premium is the monthly bill you pay to the insurance company, but not all medical expenses. Deductibles are the amount of money you pay yourself before the health insurance, copayment is the fixed amount you have to pay for a prescription, coinsurance is a percentage that your insurance agrees to pay, and out-of-pocket limit is the maximum amount of money you pay a year towards insurance covered health care. Different people with different backgrounds are geared toward different types, (ex: employer provided or senior citizen)
