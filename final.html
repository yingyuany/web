Class Period: 5
Project Name: Escape Rewind</h1>

<h2><a href=https://yingyuany.github.io/web/graphics.html>Website Link</a></h2>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
My project is a text based escape room in the point of view of the person playing it. By solving all 4 of the puzzles, you will be able to escape the basement of a famous serial killer.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>After opening the python file and pressing play, you will be introduced to your scenario. Navigate through the game by typing yes/no answers, your choices, and cracking the codes of these puzzles. After typing in your answer, press enter.vMaking an incorrect answer will result in being asked to try again, or be taken back to the beginning of the game.
</p>
<h2>How it work</h2>
<p>This project is based mainly around text based functions in python such as print and input. Throughout the game, there are many images that will open containing the puzzle or png visualization of the game.
</p>

<h2>Resources used</h2>
<p>Python Library PIL. This allowed me to open,read, and attach images to whenever is needed in the program.</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>Inputs must be an exact match or will also be exact copy.
Sometimes, when pressing enter will lead to the beginning instead of going on.</p>
